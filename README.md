Alternatives
~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you don't like [worldti.me](https://worldti.me), you may prefer
[starts-at.com](https://www.starts-at.com).  However, we think worldti.me has
several advantages:

- Shorter URLs (20 chars vs about 60 chars)
- About 10x more lightweight (compressed: 44kb vs 495kb, uncompressed: 135kb vs
  1180kb)
- No tracking (starts-at.com uses Google Analytics which explicitly tracks
  users, and the Cloudflare/Boostrap/Google CDNs which implicitly track users)
- Picking a date is optional
- Open source
- Cleaner design (in our opinion!)
